## How to Play

1. Visit the [game website](https://clonetris.vercel.app/).
2. Use the arrow keys (or on-screen buttons) to move and rotate the falling tetrominoes.
3. Try to complete horizontal lines without leaving gaps to clear them.
4. The game speeds up as you clear more lines, so be quick and strategic!
5. The game ends when the tetrominoes reach the top.
